Due to complications with building a jar file with Maven, we have not been able to include a single jar file of our project. Instead, you will have to follow these instructions to run our project.
You will need IntelliJ, as well as Java 1.8.0.
1) Import the project with IntelliJ.
2) In the top right of the screen, click the dropdown next to the hammer icon and select "Edit Configurations...".
3) Click the plus sign in the top left and select "Application"
4) In the "Main class" field type "Program.VehicleRoutingProblem" and apply the changes.
5) Exit the window and click the green arrow next to the dropdown to run the project.
